# 🎯 BISV Senior Project — Cricket Game Predictor & Toss Decision Suggester

An interactive RShiny application that predicts the outcome of cricket games played on [CricClubs.com](https://cricclubs.com) and provides strategic toss decision suggestions based on historical data.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This project combines data analysis, machine learning, and sports strategy to help teams make informed decisions before a game.

- **Data Source**: Extracted directly from the CricClubs database using SQL.
- **Analysis**: Performed in R, culminating in an RShiny application.
- **Functionality**: Given two teams, a location, and selected players, the app:
  - Predicts the **likely winner** of the game.
  - Suggests whether the toss-winning team should **bat or bowl first**.

---

## 🔮 Predictor Module

Uses machine learning models to forecast the winner based on:

- Team win percentages  
- Home field advantage  
- Player statistics  
- Head-to-head performance

**Modeling Approach**:
- Primary model: **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - User-adjustable kernel and cost parameters through the app
- Also experimented with: **Logistic Regression** and **Gradient Boosting**
- Achieved a **74% prediction accuracy**

## 🧩 Suggester Module

Recommends toss decisions using historical game outcomes:

- Categorizes past games into:
  - *Lost toss, lost game*
  - *Won toss, lost game*
  - *Won toss, won game*
  - *Lost toss, won game*

Given the selected team, opponent, and location, a classification algorithm suggests whether to bat or bowl first if the team wins the toss.
